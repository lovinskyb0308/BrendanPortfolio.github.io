		<h2>Scratch Content</h2>
		<h1>Name Assignment</h1>
		<p>
			<img src="Images/nameAssignment.jpg"/ width="400" height="300">
		</p>
		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p> Use scratch to design and create a program that shows my name. The requirements were to add a sprite for each letter in my name and give them 3 unique behaviors.  The program needed to run when the green flag was clicked and for extra credit I added a function to reset the scene to the beginning each time the green flag was clicked.
		</p>
		<h2>Concepts Learned:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Using event blocks - green flag clicked, when key pressed</li>
			<li>Conditional statements - used if statements to……</li>
			<li>Used loops - I used a forever block to……, I used a repeat until block to…….</li>
			<li>Sprites - I created my own sprites using the sprite editor,  I used the library of sprites to find letters in my name and adjusted the costumes, .....</li>
			<li>Movement - I used the x and y values to make my sprites move to their original location when the green flag was clicked,  I rotated the sprites to …….</li>
			
			<h1>Computer Buying Assignment</h1>
		<p>
			<img src="Images/computerProject.png"/ width="400" height="300">
		</p>
		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p> Used scratch to help someone buy a computer by giving 4 options. I then told them all the information about the computer (processor, portability, space, etc). I had sprites that I made do a little skit about asking another sprite what computer he wants and tell him all of the details of the 4 computer options. I then singled out a computer for the person based on what he wants it for and what requirements he had for it.

		</p>
		<h2>Concepts Learned:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>“If then”</li>
			<li>Change background</li>
			<li>Speach</li>
			<li>Wait for____seconds</li>
			<li>Timing of programing</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p> I made a game. It was a super mario game only not as good. But I did have cheat codes.
